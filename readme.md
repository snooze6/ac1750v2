# AC1750 v2

## Introduction

So I bought this router from Amazon because is full-compatible with OpenWRT. You know that is v2 because of the sticker of the router, it says something like:
```
ver: 2.0
```
On the top-right corner of the sticker.

So the first thing I did was update the firmware.

__Please do not update the firmware__

It says in the official page that it's locked, it won't let you flash OpenWRT or any custom firmware, so what should we do now?

## Escaping the matrix I

The upgrading page of the router says error 18005 in every firmware that I tried to flash but there's another flashing methoud using tftp, so let's try it!.

First of all we must set our IP to 192.168.0.66, that's the IP in which the router will search for the firmware.

Then we can open a tftp server on our pc using [this link](http://tftpd32.jounin.net/tftpd32_download.html) for instance but you can use whatever you want.

We set the firmware name to:
```
ArcherC7v2_tp_recovery.bin
```

And we can try to flash it shutting off the router and starting it while pressing the WPS/reset button. It'll search for an tftp server and will found ours so it'll download the image and flash it.

## Escaping the matrix II

Now that we are in a previous version of the firmware which it's not locked we can flash OpenWRT as always, using the web interface.

## Upgrading the matrix

Now we'll run out of space pretty soon because of the limited memory of the router, the answer might be using a external usb as storage to gain more free space.

```bash
opkg install kmod-usb-storage kmod-scsi-core kmod-fs-msdos kmod-fs-vfat block-mount usbutils kmod-usb-core kmod-usb2 file kmod-nls-iso8859-1 kmod-nls-cp437 kmod-fs-ext4
```
With the previous packages we can see now /dev/sda1 and mount it

```bash
mkdir /mnt/sda1
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1

df
Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
rootfs                   12544      4956      7588  40% /
/dev/root                 2560      2560         0 100% /rom
tmpfs                    63020       332     62688   1% /tmp
/dev/mtdblock3           12544      4956      7588  40% /overlay
overlayfs:/overlay       12544      4956      7588  40% /
tmpfs                      512         0       512   0% /dev
/dev/sda1             15318416     38144  14482424   0% /mnt/sda1
```

Checking the mount command

```bash
# Prepare external storage root
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt ; tar -C /overlay -cvf - . | tar -C /mnt -xf - ; umount /mnt

# Create fstab
block detect > /etc/config/fstab; \
   sed -i s/option$'\t'enabled$'\t'\'0\'/option$'\t'enabled$'\t'\'1\'/ /etc/config/fstab; \
   sed -i s#/mnt/sda1#/overlay# /etc/config/fstab; \
   cat /etc/config/fstab;

reboot
```
